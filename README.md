# Pool Party Blackjack
<br/>
The origins of Blackjack is still under debate to this day. <br/>
Researchers agree (without consensus) that Blackjack probably originated in the French casinos around 1700. <br/>
The French cards were called Vingt-et-Un, translated it means twenty-one.<br/>
Besides the various versions of Vingt-et-Un, the popularity of the card games expanded through North America, thanks to the French colonists.<br/>
<br/>
However across Europe, other card games could have determined the development of... Vingt-et-Un: seen as the forerunner of Blackjack.<br/>
These card games are Spanish Trente-Un (One and Thirty), Italian Sette e Mezzo (Seven and a Half) and French Quinze (Fifteen).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The goal of blackjack is to beat the other players hand without going over 21. <br/>
1.Each player starts with two cards.<br/>
2.To "Hit" is to ask for another card.<br/>
3.To "Stay" is to hold your total and end your turn.<br/>
4.If you go over 21 you bust, and the other player wins regardless of their hand.<br/>
<br/>
notes:<br/>
1.Player 2 is the dealer and will not have a betting system for them.<br/>
2.Only play to win for both players!<br/>
