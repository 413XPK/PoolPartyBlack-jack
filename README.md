# Pool Party Blackjack

The goal of blackjack is to beat the other players hand without going over 21. <br/>
1.Each player starts with two cards.<br/>
2.To "Hit" is to ask for another card.<br/>
3.To "Stay" is to hold your total and end your turn.<br/>
4.If you go over 21 you bust, and the other player wins regardless of their hand.<br/>
<br/>
notes:<br/>
1.Player 2 is the dealer and will not have a betting system for them.<br/>
2.Only play to win for both players!<br/>
